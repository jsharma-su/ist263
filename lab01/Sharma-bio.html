        My name is Jiya Sharma and I am currently a Mathematics major and I am interested in possibly becoming a math teacher one day. I am captain of the club gymnastics team here at Syracuse. I love to watch movies outside of classes and working, some of my favorites include The Greatest Showman, Pitch Perfect, and any movie with Adam Sandler in it. I just added this minor in Information Technology and Management and am excited to see what kind of doors open for me in my future job searches.
