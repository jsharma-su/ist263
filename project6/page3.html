    <h3 id="main">Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While at the airport when you first arrive to anywhere in Europe, I would definitely recommend bringing American cash to exchange for euros right there, unless you can find a good exchange rate at your bank.</li>
        <li>Make sure to book any trips within or outside of where you travel as early in advance as possible.</li>
        <li>When going to Europe, I would say the best clothing to bring are neutral colors that can go with a lot so you can rewear your outfits with different tops and bottoms. They dress a lot nicer in Europe than they do in the US, so if you are looking to fit in their culture that's what I would recommend.</li>

    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Italy has to be one of my favorite cuisines ever, so being able to only eat Italian for an entire Summer was amazing. For lunches it was super easy and quick to grab a pizza or a sandwich, both are typically under 10 euros and were great on the go food so you can continue to walk around the cities. If you're anything like me and love iced coffee, you're not going to find it many places except for a very American cafe called Shake Cafe and they are located all over the city of Florence. A huge tip about ordering at restaurants is that when the waiters come and ask you if you want sparkling or flat water, say "tap water", it's the only free type of water! Paying for water was such a pain until I figured that one out. There is also a water fountain located in Florence on Piazza della Signoria! There is sometimes a line but it moves quick.</p>

    <h3>Attractions, are they worth it?</h3>
    <p>Depending where you go around Italy/Europe there are a lot of different places to visit. Visiting at least a few museums is crucial. If you want to see certain pieces of art I would say choose a few that are more important than others. If you do not care about pieces of art specifically I would say going into Churches, Chapels, and Basilicas are the way to go because they all have tons of artwork there.</p>

    <h3>Souvenirs</h3>
    <p>I'd say getting a postcard from every city that you choose to visit is a great way to keep memories of these places. Small things in each city are cheap and will still provide the memories. Though with small places on the street, they usually only take euros and no type of cards, which I did not realize at first. Getting refrigerator magnets or t-shirts are a great idea as well and shouldn't be too expensive.</p>
