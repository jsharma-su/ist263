    <div><p class="margin">During my trip abroad I had the opportunity to travel around the country of Italy and a trip outside of the country. At other times in my life I had the privelage of taking other trips around Europe and thought I might as well share my reviews on them too. This page is designed to help you figure out where are easy places to go and how to get there. I want this page to emphasize traveling within Italy and how I was able to do it with ease, and with these tips, you can too!</p></div>

    <div><h2>Day Trips</h2></div>
    <div><h3 class="city">City: Bologna</h3></div>
    <div><p class="city">The city of Bologna is a beautiful spot to travel to and visit. With a less than an hour train ride that was taken from Florence I spent the day in Bologna where I got to walk around the city, shop, and watch some live shows and music that was going on around the town square. It had amazing restaurants ranging from Italian to Japanese cuisines and it is home of Bolognese, which was the most immaculate bowl of Bolognese I had ever eaten in my life. The city was small and quaint but had a lot of areas to do so much in the small city. This was an extremely easy travel experience and when I went I traveled on a Friday afternoon and was back by the nighttime and was able to see and od so much in a short amount of time. </p></div>
    <div><h3 class="city">City: Florence</h3></div>
    <div><p class="city">I was so very lucky to be able to spend six weeks in my 20s in Florence, Italy. These six weeks flew by faster than I've ever experienced before and I find myself constantly looking back in time at the photos and memories from my time there. The city was extremely easy to navigate and walk around in and every day there was something new to do for me. Whether it was going to a window on the end of a street corner where they sold wine, to going to the Gucci Museum with a student discount of 8 euros for entry. The scenery around this city was adequate enough for me and if I never went inside any of these buildings I would have been just as satisfied because of the outside architecture. I traveled around the city by walking, taxis, and even electric scooters and bikes, but watch out for all those cobblestone streets because you'll be in for some bumpy rides!</p></div><br>
    <div><h3 class="city">City: Pisa</h3></div>
    <div><p class="city">Pisa may be known for the leaning tower, but there is so much more to it. The city was beautiful and had an amazing area to shop and buy souveniers. There was a pass I had bought that was not too pricy and I was able to then go into all of the buildings around the leaning tower, like the Museum or the Cathedral or the Balisca that had such beautiful art everywhere. If you are smart enough to buy tickets in advance you can book tickets to walk up the leaning tower</p></div>

    <div><h3 class="city">City: Venice</h3></div>
    <div><p class="city">To get to Venice, I took a train from Florence which was about 2 hours long. There were round trip train tickets and there were a large amount of times to pick from within a similar price range of each other. You are able to pick from a range of different trains that also can have connections of trains with a chance of a lower price for getting there and back. I was able to book a Gondola ride in Venice where I had a 30 minute ride around the city with a guide who was very knowledgeable about the city. I learned the best way to minimize the cost of these trips is to book everything as early as possible.
