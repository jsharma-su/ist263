       <div><p>Are you a fan of traveling? Are you in your young adult years? Are you worried about your spending? This website is designed to help you travel abroad on a budget! Experiences like traveling last forever and there is an endless amount of things to do when you travel. Studying abroad while in college was something that I have always wanted to do and this past Summer I was able to do so while also on a budget from money saved up throughout my life. Here are photos of places I was able to visit while studying abroad in Florence!</p></div>
